** Building
In order to build this program you must have the ~i386~ GCC cross-compiled on your system. Instructions can be found on the [[https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler][OSDev Wiki]]. You will also need ~grub~ and ~nasm~.

Then, a simple ~make~ will generate the iso. You can run the iso by ~dd~'ing it to a usb stick or by running it with ~qemu-system-i386~. If you are running on native hardware make sure to boot it with BIOS (some PC's call it Legacy Support).

** Using pre-compiled image
This project contains a pre-compiled iso file in ~demo~. Simply ~cd demo~ and ~qemu-system-i386 os.iso~ or run ~make demo~.
