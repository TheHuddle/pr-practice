# PREPROCESSED C HELLO WORLD
Includes a basic Makefile to build the program. Tested on Linux Mint.

The program prints `hello, world.` and then reports first 3 non-zero fibonacci numbers.

The program works by emulating a machine with a very crippled and limited instruction set. I would liked to have added conditional branching intructions, but the machine was designed on the fly with no research or design work done before.

## Buidling the project
`make`

## Running the project
`make run`
or
`./hello_world`
